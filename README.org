* About
Harpoon package for emacs, based on the plugin from [[https://github.com/ThePrimeagen/harpoon][ThePrimeagen]].

This package offers quick bookmarks separated by project and branch.  You can quick navigate between your working files and forget about that files opened that you will not use anymore.

Harpoon is more a way to manage and quick navigate between the main files that you are working on than a bookmark system.

* Customizing
You can customize by setting this variable:

| Variable                         | Description                                                                        | Default                |
| harpoon-separate-by-branch       | If nil, ignores the branch                                                         | t                      |
| harpoon-project-package          | Package used to harpoon to get project stuff.  Available: projectile, project      | 'projectile            |
| harpoon-without-project-function | Function used to return a name for harpoon cache file when not visiting a project. | 'harpoon--package-name |

** Extra tips for ~harpoon-without-project-function~
If you want that harpoon behaves uses the current file directory, change it to 'harpoon--current-file-directory

If you use doom , you can set this variable to '+workspace-current-name and use the workspace name instead the harpoon global.

You can also create your own function to determine the harpoon cache file and add to this variable.
