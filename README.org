* Customizing
You can customize by setting this variable:

| Variable                         | Description                                                                           | Default                          |
| harpoon-separate-by-branch       | If nil, ignores the branch                                                            | t                                |
| harpoon-project-package          | Package used to harpoon to get project stuff.  Available: projectile, project         | 'projectile                      |
| harpoon-without-project-function | Function used to return a name for harpoon cache file when not visiting a project. | 'harpoon--current-file-directory |

** Extra tips for ~harpoon-without-project-function~
If you use doom (with persp-mode), you can use '+workspace-current-name and use the workspace name instead current file directory.

You can also create your own function to determine the harpoon cache file and add to this variable.
